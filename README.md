# QIBLA
Qibla is a simple application designed to help users find the direction of the Qibla from their current location, making it easier to offer prayers in the correct direction. The app uses geolocation services to determine the user's current location and draws a line towards the Kaaba, providing a visual indicator that serves as proof for users.

# ABOUT
The Qibla app is currently under development, and the initial version is written in a "spaghetti code" style. However, future plans include refining the codebase, adding more features, and making the application more user-friendly, mobile-responsive, and progressive.

# FEATURES
Qibla Direction: Provides the direction of the Qibla based on your current location.

Visual Line Indicator: Draws a line pointing directly to the Kaaba to offer users a visual cue, making it look more authentic and reliable.

Geolocation-Based: Utilizes geolocation to pinpoint the user's exact location for accurate Qibla direction.

# FUTURE PLANS
Code Refactoring: Improve the code structure to enhance readability, maintainability, and scalability.

Mobile-Friendly Design: Make the app fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

Progressive Web App (PWA): Convert the application into a Progressive Web App to enable offline access and faster loading times.

Additional Features: Add more features like prayer times, nearby mosques, compass mode, and more customization options.

# DEVELOPMENT STATUS
This application is currently in its early stages of development. It has a basic implementation of the main functionality, but there are many improvements and new features planned for future updates.
